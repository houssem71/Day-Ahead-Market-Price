# Day-Ahead-Market-Price
In the realm of energy markets, predicting day-ahead market prices of power holds immense significance for stakeholders ranging from power generators to consumers and policymakers. This project aims to employ advanced time series forecasting techniques, specifically leveraging Auto-Regressive (AR) models, to predict day-ahead market prices of power in North America. Moreover, it incorporates outage and load data as predictors to enhance the accuracy and robustness of the forecasting model.
The methodology involves collecting historical data on day-ahead market prices of power, outage events, and load patterns across North America. These datasets are preprocessed and analyzed to identify temporal patterns, seasonality, and potential correlations. The AR model is then trained using this data, utilizing lagged observations of market prices, outage occurrences, and load levels to forecast future price movements.
